                    <p>For the purposes of clarity and navigation, I will explain the structure of the website. There are three publicly available pages: "Home", "Gallery", and "Database." These pages fill out the bulk of the frontend requirements. There is also a "Login" page, where there exists a validated form with page redirection and error throwing. After completing a successful login, you are brought to the final "Admin" page. The admin and database pages both include outlets of the database API routes, reading database information and printing it to a table. The admin page also include two other routes: forms for adding and deleting records to the database. There's also an external link on that page exclusively cause it's ugly and irrelevant. Most other requirements can be found spread around the website.</p>

                    <p>At Rescue Nest, our mission is to provide a safe haven for abandoned, stray, and surrendered household pets in need of rehabilitation and care. We are dedicated to restoring the health and well-being of dogs, cats, birds, lizards, and even fish, offering them a second chance at life. Whether it’s a furry friend lost on the streets or a pet whose owners can no longer care for them, we ensure every animal that enters our shelter receives the love, medical attention, and rehabilitation they deserve. We understand that each animal is unique, and our compassionate team works tirelessly to meet their individual needs, helping them regain trust and confidence.</p>

                    <p>We invite you to explore the work we do at Rescue Nests and see how you can be a part of our mission to give abandoned and stray pets a new lease on life. Whether you’re considering adopting a loving companion or simply want to make a difference, there are many ways to get involved. Take the time to visit our shelter, meet our adorable and resilient animals, and consider giving one of them a forever home. Each pet has a unique story, and by adopting, you not only provide them with a loving family but also help reduce the burden on overcrowded shelters. If you’re not in a position to adopt, there are plenty of other ways to support our cause—whether it’s through donations, volunteering your time, or spreading the word to friends and family. By sharing our mission, you help us reach more people who can help us save more lives. Your support allows us to continue offering rehabilitation, medical care, and a safe space for pets in need. Every small act makes a big difference in the lives of these animals, and together, we can create a brighter future for them.</p>
